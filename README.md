Deployment instructions for the "Ball Pathway Prediction Application" involve setting up the necessary environment, installing dependencies, and running the application.
## Project Installation
Ensure that Python 3.10 is installed on your system. 
If not, download and install Python from the official website and follow the install instruction.
After installation open cmd in your target folder and check the python 3.10 is available. Because above 3.10 python version is required.
        
    python --version

If you canâ€™t find python 3.10 in cmd add your path in environmental variable and move to top in the list . 
Next step is clone project from git repository.
  
 	git clone https://github.com/smsivanujan/ball_pathway_prediction_application.git

After that change directory path to where our project placed in folder.

    cd ball_pathway_prediction_application\ball_pathway_prediction

Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the application.

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

Install the necessary Python libraries in requirements.txt using pip.
	
    pip install -r requirements.txt
	
4. Run the Application
Run the Python script to launch the application.

    python main.py

Enjoy
